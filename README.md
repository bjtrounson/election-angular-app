# Election Angular App
Recreation of a previous React project I created for a course in my bachelors with the same Election model, but I have improved something's about it. This time using Angular as I wanted to mess around with it and see how it compares to React.

The app is hosted on railway.app and can be found [here](https://election-app.bitcastle.dev/).

If you want to run the app locally, you can do so by cloning the repo and running `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the app.
## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
